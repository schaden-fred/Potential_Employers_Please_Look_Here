#  Potential Employers, please look here.
This repo contains sample code that I've written in various languages.  Potential employers should view this in order to see examples of my work.

Due to the nature of NDAs, I cannot list a majority of my work here.  What is shown is typically a generic piece of code that demonstates ability, but which would need to be refined in order to be used in a production environment.
